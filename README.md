# CountriesApp----React-Native

#### This is a mobile app developed for iOS. This app was a practice run for using apis within react-native as well as working on my skills. Users can find information about a country's population and capital city.

#### In order to run this app, follow the following command:

> npm install

#### I have added a script that allows me to run the ios development version, just type the following command:
> npm run ios
